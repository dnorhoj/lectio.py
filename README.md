# Looking for a new maintainer

I am graduating in summer, and therefore the continued development of lectio.py will stop. (It has been halted for a while as I don't have motivation as I'm not going to be able to use it in a few months.)

You can find my contact details in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/dnorhoj) if you want to continue the development!
